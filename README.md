## 📌 Project Overview

> **Note:** This app was fully generated using **AI tools** (ChatGPT, Curser AI, Gemini API).  
> I focused on understanding:
> - 🧱 Architecture (Frontend + Backend + AI)
> - 🔗 API integration with Gemini & MySQL
> - ⚙️ Internal backend working
> - 🧪 Running via Android Studio Emulator

This was a **real-world learning project**, building a complete smart app with AI — without writing code manually, but thoroughly understanding how it works.

## 🔐 Gemini API Setup

1. Go to: [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Copy your API key
3. Paste it inside the service file:

```js
// services/geminiAPI.js
const GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here";
```

## 🧠 Example AI Prompt Used

```json
You are a productivity assistant. Convert the user's sentence to this format:
{
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "due_date": "",
  "priority": "",
  "labels": [],
  "suggested_subtasks": []
}
Input: "Finish frontend for my project by Friday evening"
```

## 📦 Backend Notes

Backend includes:

* 📮 `/api/parse-task` for Gemini prompt handling
* 🧾 `/api/tasks` to store, edit, and delete user tasks
* 🔑 JWT Auth or Firebase Auth (pluggable)
* 💾 MySQL schema: `users`, `tasks`, `subtasks`, `history`

---

## 📲 Tested On

* ✅ Android Studio Emulator (Pixel 5 - API 34)
* ⏳ iOS testing in progress

---

## 🚧 Roadmap / Next Features

* [ ] 📅 Drag-and-drop calendar
* [ ] 🤝 Task sharing & collaboration
* [ ] 💬 In-app AI chat assistant
* [ ] 🧠 On-device AI fallback (Gemini Nano)
* [ ] 💳 Subscriptions for premium AI features

## 🤖 Built with AI

This entire project was created with **AI tools**, not by hand.
I used:

* `Curser AI` for full-stack generation
* `ChatGPT` to understand and debug code
* `Gemini API` to power the smart features

> My focus was to **learn through implementation**, not manually write every line.
> I now understand full-stack app structure, AI integration, REST APIs, backend logic, and mobile deployment.
